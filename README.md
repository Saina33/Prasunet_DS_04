# Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## Overview
This project was completed as part of my internship at Prasunet Company, focusing on analyzing traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The goal was to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors using Power BI.

## Dataset
The dataset used includes the following columns:
- AADFYear
- CP
- Estimation_method
- Estimation_method_detailed
- Region
- LocalAuthority
- Road
- RoadCategory
- Easting
- Northing
- StartJunction
- EndJunction
- LinkLength_km
- LinkLength_miles
- PedalCycles
- Motorcycles
- CarsTaxis
- BusesCoaches
- LightGoodsVehicles
- V2AxleRigidHGV
- V3AxleRigidHGV
- V4or5AxleRigidHGV
- V3or4AxleArticHGV
- V5AxleArticHGV
- V6orMoreAxleArticHGV
- AllHGVs
- AllMotorVehicles
- Lat
- Lon

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard created for this analysis includes the following features:
- **Slicers:** Filter the data by AADF Year, Road Category, and Region.
- **Bar Graph:** Displays the count of all motor vehicles by road category and region.
- **Line Chart:** Shows the count of all motor vehicles by AADF Year.
- **Map:** Visualizes the count of motorcycles by latitude and longitude.

## Key Insights
- Identified patterns in traffic accidents related to different road conditions and times of day.
- Pinpointed accident hotspots using map visualizations.
- Analyzed vehicle counts and trends over time to understand the impact of various factors on traffic accidents.

## Learnings
This project enhanced my skills in data analysis and visualization, allowing me to create interactive dashboards that provide valuable insights into traffic accident data.
